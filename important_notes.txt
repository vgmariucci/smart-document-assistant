Some useful commands to use in bash to manage python libraries:

- To build a "requirements.txt" file using pip:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

- To install the libraries listed in a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

- This installs the packages inside the Poetry-managed virtual environment:

poetry add $(cat requirements.txt)
